// Question 64: Combine Strings and Numbers: Write a function that merges a piece of text with a number. For example, if provided with "Age: " and 30, it should give back "Age: 30".
// Explain & TIP: In JavaScript, the + operator can add numbers together or join strings. Mixing a string with a number changes the number into a string for the joining.

const text_with_numb = (text:string,numb:number)=> {
   return (`"${text}:${numb}"`)
}
console.log(text_with_numb("maadeha",20));
